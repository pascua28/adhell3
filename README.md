# Disclaimer
Adhell3 is merely an app that is using the Samsung Knox Standard SDK APIs. <br/>
In order to use these APIs, the Knox Standard SDK and an Enterprise License Key (ELM) are needed. <br/>
These are Samsung's properties which are not available in this repository and therefore they need to be downloaded and obtained by the developer after accepting the agreement given by Samsung. <br/>
The developer is then responsible how this app will be used and I don't take any responsibilities of any damages caused by this app. <br/>

The Knox Standard SDK can be downloaded here: https://seap.samsung.com/sdk/knox-standard-android <br/>
The Enterprise License Key can be obtained here: https://seap.samsung.com/license-keys/create/knox_standard_android <br/>
The API can be found here: https://seap.samsung.com/api-references/android-standard/reference/packages.html


# Background
The original Adhell was developed by Samsung's developer. After he was forced to remove the code from internet by Samsung, FiendFyre was stepped up by providing the Adhell2. But after a while, it is also discontinued.<br/>
Adhell3 is an extension of previous discontinued Adhell2 app with more additional features.


## Features
- Mobile and Wi-Fi access disabler<br/>
Disable internet access when on mobile or/and Wi-Fi for specific apps. This can be useful to avoid watching video accidentally by using mobile data.

- Custom deny firewall rule<br/>
This can be used for example to define a custom firewall rule to block ads for Chrome app on port 53 for all ip addresses:<br/>
    `com.android.chrome|*|53`

- Whitelist URL for a specific app<br/>
When you have a domain that you want to block system wide, but you need this domain on a particular app. Otherwise, the app won't work.<br/>
Instead whitelist-ing this app, you can just whitelist that domain for this app.<br/>
Example: Block the domain `graph.facebook.com` system wide, but allows it for Facebook Messenger so that it can be used for login:<br/>
    `com.facebook.orca|graph.facebook.com`

- Support local host source<br/>
The host file can be located on internal or external storage.<br/>
An example to use host.txt file which is located at internal storage:<br/>
    `file:///mnt/sdcard/hosts.txt`

- Show the content of host source<br/>
Show the list of domains of individual host source or the list of all blocked domains from all host sources.<br/>
This can be useful to check whether particular domain is in the list.<br/>
The list contains of unique domains.

- Retain data across installations<br/>
Adhell is usually generated with a unique package name. For the users that don't build Adhell with Android Studio, they cannot use the same package name. This means that they need to reinstall Adhell every times there is a new version and on every installation, they need to input the same data again and again. <br/>
With this feature, there is no need to export or import functionality again. The data will be kept on internal storage and by next installation, the same data will be used.

- Backup and restore database<br/>
Backup the content of the database on internal storage so that later it can be used to restore the database if the database is somehow damage.

- App components<br/>
Ability to disable app's permissions, services and receivers. Only user apps are supported.

- DNS per application basis<br/>
Set custom DNS for selected apps. Only user apps are supported.

## Prerequisite for building apk
### Source code
- Clone the project with `git clone git@gitlab.com:fusionjack/adhell3.git adhell3`<br/>
Or download the source code as a zip file: https://gitlab.com/fusionjack/adhell3/repository/master/archive.zip
- Set `applicationId` with a valid package name in `app\build.gradle`, e.g.: com.dhf.erz58384

### Android Studio
- Download and install latest Android Studio from https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html
- Open the downloaded project in Android Studio
- Install missing SDK and build-tools
- For `Configuration on demand is not supported` error, see this comment https://gitlab.com/fusionjack/adhell3/commit/1fb8ea98cf43507b32db56d9fb584b33dc6579f1#note_74463246

### Knox Standard SDK
- Download it from https://seap.samsung.com/sdk/knox-standard-android
- Take the `libs` content and put it to `app\libs` folder in the project 

## How to build apk
- Run the following command in a console to change the current directory to adhell3 folder: `cd adhell3`
- Update the source code retaining your `applicationId` with `git stash && git pull --rebase && git stash pop`<br/>
  (the above "stashes" your changes, downloads the latest sources from gitlab, and then reinstates the modified package name `applicationId`)
- Build the apk with the following command `gradlew clean assembleDebug`
- The generated apk is located in `app\build\outputs\apk\debug`
